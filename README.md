# Black-Scholes Option Calculator

A simple option calculator built with Streamlit. I wanted to better understand the Black-Scholes model and the Greeks, so what better way than to build it from scratch?


## Running the Application

1. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
